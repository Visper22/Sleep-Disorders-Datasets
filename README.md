## [Apnea-ECG Database](https://physionet.org/content/apnea-ecg/1.0.0/)
Published: Feb. 10, 2000. Version: 1.0.0

The Apnea-ECG Database was designed to support the development of automated methods for detecting sleep apnea events, with a primary focus on ECG signals.

- 70 ECG records from 7 hours to 10 hours
- 16 bits per sample, least significant byte first in each pair, 100 samples per second, nominally 200 A/D units per millivolt
- Apnea annotations (derived by human experts on the basis of simultaneously recorded respiration and related signals), every minute indicating the presence or absence of apnea at that time
- Machine-generated QRS annotations (in which all beats regardless of type have been labeled normal) made using sqrs125. 
- Records a01 through a04, b01, and c01 through c03 are accompanied by additional signals: chest and abdominal respiratory effort signals obtained using inductance plethysmography (Resp C and Resp A), oronasal airflow measured using nasal thermistors (Resp, N), and oxygen saturation (SpO2).

### Notes
- "In April 2013, Chiu-wen Wu reported that training set control records c05 and c06 come from the same original recording (c05 begins 80 seconds later than c06). c06 may have been a corrected version of c05.". [From Apnea-ECG DB site](https://physionet.org/content/apnea-ecg/1.0.0/)
- .qrs files are unaudited and contain errors. [From Apnea-ECG DB site](https://physionet.org/content/apnea-ecg/1.0.0/)
- Some ECG recordings (a10, a12, a19, b05, c01, c04, c07, c09, and x17) are reversed. [(Yang et al.)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010482521009185)
- Several studies reported that the signals from the database are raw signals, so artifact removal techiques were used to remove noise, such as noise from movement during sleep [(Li et al., 2024)](10.1109/TIM.2024.3440369), [(Krithika et al., 2024)](10.1109/ICIC3S61846.2024.106030499), [(Jiao et al., 2024)](10.1109/OJEMB.2024.3405666), [(Wei et al., 2024)](10.1109/IMCEC59810.2024.10575752), [(Mashrur et al. 2021)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010482521003267).
- [(Travieso et al.)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925231213009041) evaluated the quality of the ECG signals following pre-defined characteristics and "after discarding the affected segments, the recordings are reduced to a 54.76% of its duration in the worst case and 89.09% in the best case, per patient. The mean extracted length of the database recordings is 76.94%.". They employ this process of discarding the noisy or low quality segments instead of applying typical filtering techniques.




## [CAP Sleep Database](https://physionet.org/content/capslpdb/1.0.0/)
Published: July 26, 2012. Version: 1.0.0

The Cyclic Alternating Pattern (CAP) is a periodic EEG activity that occursg during NREM sleep, characterized by two phase: A-phase (A1, A2 or A3) and B-phase). CAP is a marker of sleep instability and can be correlated with several sleep disorders. The CAP Sleep database provides a diverse set of recordings collected at the Sleep Disorders Center of the Ospedale Maggiore of Parma in Italy. The records include CAP annotations supporting the development and evaluation of automated CAP detection algorithms, as well as studies on the dynamics of CAP. Although the primary purpose of the CAP Sleep database is CAP analysis, the CAP sleep database could also be used for the development of sleep stage automatic detection algorithms and sleep disorders detecntion algorithms. However, for the latter the set would be really unbanlced.

- 108 polysomnographic records
- Records include multiple pre-filtered biosignals: at least 3 EEG channels (F3 or F4, C3 or C4 and O1 or O2, referred to A1 or A2) and EOG (2 channels), EMG of the submentalis muscle, bilateral anterior tibial EMG, respiration signals (airflow, abdominal and thoracic effort, and SaO2) and ECG.
- Some records may have additional EEG traces (Fp1-F3, F3-C3, C3-P3, P3-O1 and/or Fp2-F4, F4-C4, C4-P4, P4-O2)
- Sampling rate varies between and within signals

### Annotations

Sleep macrostructure was scored according to the Rechtschaffen & Kales rules, while the CAP was detected in agreement with Terzanoâ€™s reference atlas of rules.

### Notes
- Body position was not recorded in some subjects
- Not all subjects have all of the mentioned signals recorded
- A-phase annotations include distintion of waht subtype it is (A1, A2, A3)
- Though the signals are pre-filtered some studies still employed some kind of filtering [(Sheng-Hsiou et al. 2018)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811918306888), [(Yan et al. 2019)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1746809418302647), [(Sharma et al. 2023)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010482523007242#b36), [(Agarwal et al. 2024)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389945724004465).
- Not clear about ECG lead positioning
- Channel names are inconsistent




## [St. Vincent's University Hospital / University College Dublin Sleep Apnea Database](https://physionet.org/content/apnea-ecg/1.0.0/)
Published: Oct. 9, 2007. Version: 1.0.0 (revised on 1 September 2011)

The database provides overnight polysomnograms and simultaneous three-channel Holter ECG recordings from adults with suspected sleep-disordered breathing, collected at St. Vincent's University Hospital Sleep Disorders Clinic. It can be used for multiple porposes, such as sleep stage classification and sleep apnea event detection. Studies have been made on sleep/wake classification and sleep stage classification [(Abdulla et al. 2023)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386505623000187). Other studies focused on obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) events detection [(Taghizadegan et al. 2021)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030698772100178X#b0050), [(Hou et al. 2025)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169260724005510), [(Mashrur et al. 2021)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010482521003267), [(Cai et al. 2025)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1746809424010516), while others focused in general apnea event detection [(Fatimah et al. 2020)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1746809420301610).

### Subjects

Subjects had to be above 18 years of age, with no known cardiac disease, autonomic dysfunction, and not on medication known to interfere with heart rate. They were randomly selected over a 6-month period (September 2002 to February 2003) from patients referred to the Sleep Disorders Clinic at St Vincent's University Hospital, Dublin, for possible diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea, central sleep apnea or primary snoring. 

| Characteristic | Description                       |

### Annotations

Sleep stages were scored by an experienced sleep technologist according to the Rechtschaffen & Kales rules. Onset time and duration of respiratory events were annotated by the same sleep technologist.

### Notes
-  The recording dates and times are not available
-  In record ucddb002, only two distinct ECG signals were recorded; the second ECG signal was also used as the third signal
-  [(Geng et el.)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1746809421007291) discarded poor ECG quality signals though they do not mention which. Additionally, the methods for R-peak detection was chosen specifically for signals with poor quality.
-  Several studies used filtering to remove artifacts [(Taghizadegan et al. 2021)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030698772100178X#b0050), [(Hou et al. 2025)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169260724005510), [(Mashrur et al. 2021)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010482521003267).
