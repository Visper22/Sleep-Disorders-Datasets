## [Apnea-ECG Database](https://physionet.org/content/apnea-ecg/1.0.0/)
Published: Feb. 10, 2000. Version: 1.0.0

The Apnea-ECG Database was designed to support the development of automated methods for detecting sleep apnea events, with a primary focus on ECG signals.

### It contains:
- 70 ECG records from 7 hours to 10 hours
- 16 bits per sample, least significant byte first in each pair, 100 samples per second, nominally 200 A/D units per millivolt
- Apnea annotations (derived by human experts on the basis of simultaneously recorded respiration and related signals), every minute indicating the presence or absence of apnea at that time
- Machine-generated QRS annotations (in which all beats regardless of type have been labeled normal) made using sqrs125. 
- Records a01 through a04, b01, and c01 through c03 are accompanied by additional signals: chest and abdominal respiratory effort signals obtained using inductance plethysmography (Resp C and Resp A), oronasal airflow measured using nasal thermistors (Resp, N), and oxygen saturation (SpO2).

The Cyclic Alternating Pattern (CAP) of EEG Activity During Sleep
The Cyclic Alternating Pattern (CAP) is a periodic EEG activity occurring during NREM sleep. It is characterized by cyclic sequences of cerebral activation (phase A) followed by periods of deactivation (phase B) which separate two successive phase A periods with an interval <1 min. A phase A period and the following phase B period define a CAP cycle, and at least two CAP cycles are required to form a CAP sequence.

See CAP-sequence.jpg for an example of cyclic alternating pattern (CAP) in sleep stage 2. A CAP cycle is defined as a phase A period followed by a phase B period lasting a minute or less. Two or more adjacent CAP cycles define a CAP sequence.

Phase A periods are subdivided into three subtypes:

Subtype A1: synchronized events with low impact on autonomic and somatomotor activities;
Subtype A2: mixed synchronizedâ€“desynchronized EEG events with an intermediate influence on the autonomic and somatomotor activities; and
Subtype A3: predominantly desynchronized EEG events with heavy effects on the autonomic and somatomotor activities.
A detailed description and definition of CAP is reported in [1]. For a complete review of the history and significance of CAP, see [2].

Despite being a physiological phenomenon, CAP is also a marker of sleep instability and can be correlated with several sleep-related pathologies. In fact, on one hand CAP can reflect a reaction of the sleeping brain to any endogenous or exogenous disturbance; on the other hand, the A phase of CAP has been interpreted as a kind of gate through which pathological events more easily occur [3]. Increased amounts of CAP are often observed in sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), as well as in insomnia [4], sleep movement disorders (periodic leg movements, or PLM [5], restless leg syndrome (RLS) [6], parasomnias like REM behavior disorder (RBD), and epileptic diseases such as nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (NFLE) [7]. Pathological amounts of CAP can also be found in hypersomnias of central origin such as narcolepsy [8].

The ratio between NREM CAP sleep and total NREM sleep (CAP-rate), and the different distributions of CAP A phases with respect to sleep stages can be measured in sleep centers to characterize such pathologies. These indexes can be valuable as measures of sleep quality, but the time needed to determine them has been an obstacle to their adoption in routine clinical practice, since visual scoring of CAP phases A for an entire night of sleep recording requires expertise and lengthy, attentive analysis. The development of software capable of increasingly accurate and efficient automated analysis of CAP is beginning to result in wider clinical use of CAP indexes for diagnosis of sleep pathologies and assessment of the efficacy of therapeutic interventions.

The CAP Sleep Database
The CAP Sleep Database is a collection of 108 polysomnographic recordings registered at the Sleep Disorders Center of the Ospedale Maggiore of Parma, Italy. The waveforms (contained in the .edf files of the database) include at least 3 EEG channels (F3 or F4, C3 or C4 and O1 or O2, referred to A1 or A2), EOG (2 channels), EMG of the submentalis muscle, bilateral anterior tibial EMG, respiration signals (airflow, abdominal and thoracic effort and SaO2) and EKG. Additional traces include EEG bipolar traces, according to the 10-20 international system (Fp1-F3, F3-C3, C3-P3, P3-O1 and/or Fp2-F4, F4-C4, C4-P4, P4-O2).

The 16 healthy subjects included in the study did not present any neurological disorders and were free of drugs affecting the central nervous system. The 92 pathological recordings include 40 recordings of patients diagnosed with NFLE, 22 affected by RBD, 10 with PLM, 9 insomniac, 5 narcoleptic, 4 affected by SDB and 2 by bruxism. The age and gender of the subjects are reported in a spreadsheet (gender-age.xlsx).

The recordings are named according to the subjects' pathology:

n1-n16	No pathology (controls)
brux1-brux2	Bruxism
ins1-ins9	Insomnia
narco1-narco5	Narcolepsy
nfle1-nfle40	Nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy
plm1-plm10	Periodic leg movements
rbd1-rbd22	REM behavior disorder
sdb1-sdb4	Sleep-disordered breathing
Annotations
Expert neurologists trained at the Sleep Center provided the scoring of the sleep macrostructure, according to the Rechtschaffen & Kales rules [9], while the CAP was detected in agreement with Terzanoâ€™s reference atlas of rules [10]. All the signals were visualized and the scorings were performed using REMlogicâ„¢ software (Embla).

The scores for each recording are provided as .txt files in REMlogic report format, and also as .st files in PhysioBank-compatible format. The .txt score files have the following fields:

Sleep stage (W=wake, S1-S4=sleep stages, R=REM, MT=body movements)
Body position (Left, Right, Prone, or Supine; not recorded in some subjects)
Time of day [hh:mm:ss]
Event (either a sleep stage (SLEEP-S0..S4, REM, MT), or a phase A of CAP)
Duration (in seconds)
Location (the signal(s) in which the event can be observed)
A Matlab script is provided for reading the .txt score files easily. By launching ScoringReader.m, an array containing the scoring of the macrostructure, and three arrays containing the starting time of the CAP A phases, their duration and their subtype, are generated. The hypnogram is reported as 0 for wake, 1 to 4 for the sleep stages, according to R&K rules, and 5 for REM. The Matlab function CAP.m computes, starting from these variables, the CAP time and CAP rate according to Terzanoâ€™s rules.

The .st score files can be read using the PhysioBank ATM and other software that reads PhysioBank-compatible annotation files. These files contain the same information as the .txt files; times are encoded as for other annotation files, and each annotation's aux string contains the associated event, duration, sleep stage, location, and (where available) body position.

Applications for this database
This database is intended to provide a useful number of carefully annotated examples of CAP in a representative variety of pathophysiologic contexts, for development and evaluation of automated CAP analyzers, as well as to support basic studies of the dynamics of CAP.

Several efforts have been made to develop a reliable automatic CAP-scoring algorithm [11]. Most of these methods rely on the extraction of spectral features from the EEG and on the application of machine-learning algorithms. Although all these methods achieve good results, none of them is yet applied to clinical practice since they either require some amount of clinician intervention or do not achieve a sufficient accuracy in the classification to support the clinical diagnosis. Some recordings from this database have been used for studies on features related to CAP phase A [12-16] and for training automatic CAP detection algorithms [17].
